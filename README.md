## 🧠 Overview

Hello! I’m **Zahwa Genoveva**, a participant of the **MSIB Batch 7 Program** under **MariBelajar** in the **Data Analysis & Artificial Intelligence** track.

As part of our **Capstone Project**, my team and I developed an integrated digital solution titled **TrashTrack – Waste Management Dashboard for Landfills**, consisting of three main components:

- 📊 **Analytical Dashboard (Power BI)** – for visualizing waste management data.  
- 🌐 **Landing Page (HTML, CSS, JS)** – for public access and project presentation.  
- 📱 **Power Apps Application** – for interactive waste management operations.

This project embodies our collective learning, innovation, and commitment to sustainability through technology. ♻️
